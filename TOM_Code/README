* Preliminary note: you need to install or upgrade the library "skyfield"

pip install skyfield --upgrade


Refer to the tutorial for the "healpix" features for the Mollview representation.

* Two programs: 
1) moon_map_corr.py  # to simply plot the position of moon in zenith-azimuth plane
2) moon_map_moll.py  # plot the moon position in the mollview representation

* note: 

- edit the file to change the period of interest
- for 2) change the "options" [...] argument before launching the python script to redo the maps (option 0) or make drawings (option 1)


* execution

- needed python  v â‰¥ 3.6

> python moon_map_moll.py
 

the very first time with option 0, a file called "de421.bsp" will be created
